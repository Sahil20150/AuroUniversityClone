# AuroUniversityClone
Title: Auro University Clone Project

Description:
During my enriching summer internship in May 2023, I had the fantastic opportunity to design a clone of Auro University's website using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. This project aimed to replicate the desktop version of the Auro University website, focusing on its visual aesthetics and functionality.

Key Features:

HTML & CSS: I meticulously crafted the website's structure and layout using HTML and CSS to mimic the design of Auro University's desktop site. Attention to detail was crucial to ensure an accurate representation.

JavaScript & jQuery: To enhance user interaction and provide a seamless browsing experience, I integrated JavaScript and jQuery functionalities. This included creating dynamic elements, image sliders, and navigation menus.

Desktop-Focused Design: Although the project is not mobile-responsive, I prioritized making the website look and function flawlessly on desktop screens. The design elements, fonts, and graphics were carefully aligned with the original website's desktop version.

Visual Aesthetics: I strived to replicate the visual appeal of Auro University's website by using suitable color schemes, fonts, and imagery. This project showcases my dedication to achieving pixel-perfect design.

Educational Experience: This project not only allowed me to refine my web development skills but also provided valuable insights into the process of reverse engineering and recreating a real-world website.

Please note that this project was created for educational purposes and to demonstrate my abilities in web development. While it may not be mobile-responsive, it serves as a testament to my dedication to delivering an aesthetically pleasing and functional desktop experience. Feel free to explore the project's code and design to see my commitment to detail and precision.
